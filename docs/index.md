HPC Communities is an international collaboration founded by US [Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC)](http://casc.org/) and the UK [High Performance Computing Special Interest Group (HPC-SIG)](https://hpc-sig.org.uk).

See CASC's position paper ["Teaming Up for Impact: Regional Collaborations for Research Computing and Data", from July 31, 2025](https://casc.org/policy-publications/position-paper/teaming-up-for-impact-regional-collaborations-for-research-computing-and-data/).

# Events

We organise where HPC organisations around the world can collaborate together, share their ideas and challenges and discuss issues such as sustainability.

We first met together at our [Birds of a Feather session at ISC 2025](https://hpc-sig.org.uk/index.php/event/isc2025-bof-hpc-communities/) where we explored the formation, organization, and funding of regional and national research-focused high performance computing (HPC) communities worldwide.

We are excited to announce that we will be gathering again with a [Birds of a Feather session at SC25](https://sc25.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=bof199&sess=sess443).

# Mailing List

We have a mailing list for HPC Communities. We use this list to share information about events and activities. If you are involved in organising an HPC Community then you are very welcome to [subscribe to the list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/WA-JISC.exe?SUBED1=HPC-COMMUNITIES&A=1).
