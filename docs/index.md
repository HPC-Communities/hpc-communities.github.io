# HPC Communities

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/CASC-and-HPC-SIG.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

HPC Communities is an international collaboration founded by US [Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation (CASC)](http://casc.org/) and the UK [High Performance Computing Special Interest Group (HPC-SIG)](https://hpc-sig.org.uk).

# Events

We organise [events](events.html) where HPC organisations around the world can collaborate together, share their ideas and challenges and discuss issues such as sustainability.

# Mailing List

We have a mailing list for HPC Communities. We use this list to share information about events and activities. If you are involved in organising an HPC Community then you are very welcome to [subscribe to the list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/WA-JISC.exe?SUBED1=HPC-COMMUNITIES&A=1).
