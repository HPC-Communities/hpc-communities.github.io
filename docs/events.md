# Events

We first met together at our [Birds of a Feather session at ISC 2025](https://hpc-sig.org.uk/index.php/event/isc2025-bof-hpc-communities/) where we explored the formation, organization, and funding of regional and national research-focused high performance computing (HPC) communities worldwide.

We are excited to announce that we will be gathering again at [SC25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org).
